## **Project Development Plan: Event Stream Library (Based on ics-event-stream-lib)**

**1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the development plan for a new project, modeled after the ics-event-stream-lib repository. The goal is to create a robust library using the same technology stack, development practices, and CI/CD pipeline established in the reference project. This library will likely facilitate event-driven communication, potentially interacting with Kafka.

**2\. Project Goals**

* Develop a reusable library/module based on the identified requirements (e.g., event publishing, processing, specific business logic).  
* Ensure high code quality through linting, formatting, and comprehensive testing.  
* Establish a reliable CI/CD pipeline for automated building, testing, and publishing.  
* Maintain clear documentation for setup, usage, and contribution.  
* Adhere strictly to the technology stack and configurations found in the ics-event-stream-lib repository.

**3\. Technology Stack & Tools**

* **Language:** TypeScript  
* **Runtime:** Node.js (v18.x \- as per .nvmrc)  
* **Package Manager:** pnpm  
* **Core Libraries:**  
  * kafkajs (for Kafka interaction)  
  * aws-msk-iam-sasl-signer-js (if AWS MSK IAM authentication is required)  
  * dotenv (for environment variables)  
  * lodash (utility functions)  
  * module-alias (for path aliasing)  
  * pino / pino-pretty (for logging)  
  * ulid (for unique ID generation)  
* **Testing:**  
  * vitest (Test runner)  
  * @vitest/coverage-v8 (Code coverage)  
  * Docker & Docker Compose (for local integration testing environment, e.g., Kafka)  
* **Linting & Formatting:**  
  * ESLint (using @invenco-cloud-systems-ics/eslint-config)  
  * Prettier (using @invenco-cloud-systems-ics/eslint-config/prettierConfig)  
  * lint-staged  
  * husky (for pre-commit hooks)  
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (using workflows similar to auto-format-and-coverage.yml, build.yml, publish.yml, potentially leveraging reusable workflows like Invenco-Cloud-Systems-ICS/github-actions-internal)  
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

**4\. Project Phases & Activities**

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration (Estimated Time: 1 Week)**

* **1.1. Repository Initialization:**  
  * Create a new GitHub repository.  
  * Initialize Git (git init).  
  * Clone the repository locally.  
* **1.2. Project Scaffolding:**  
  * Initialize pnpm (pnpm init).  
  * Create directory structure (e.g., src/, tests/unit, tests/integration, env/, .github/workflows/).  
  * Add initial configuration files (.gitignore, .npmignore, .nvmrc specifying Node 18, README.md).  
* **1.3. Dependency Installation:**  
  * Install Node.js and pnpm.  
  * Install TypeScript and core dependencies (kafkajs, dotenv, lodash, pino, etc.) using pnpm.  
  * Install development dependencies (@types/\*, vitest, eslint, prettier, husky, lint-staged, rimraf, ts-node, copyfiles, etc.).  
* **1.4. TypeScript Configuration:**  
  * Create and configure tsconfig.json, mirroring the settings from the reference repo (target es6, module commonjs, strict checks, outDir ./dist, baseUrl ./src, paths for module aliases).  
* **1.5. Linting & Formatting Setup:**  
  * Create .eslintrc.js extending @invenco-cloud-systems-ics/eslint-config.  
  * Create .prettierrc.js requiring @invenco-cloud-systems-ics/eslint-config/prettierConfig.  
  * Create .eslintignore and .prettierignore.  
  * Configure husky and lint-staged (similar to .husky/pre-commit and package.json \-\> lint-staged section) to enforce checks on commit.  
* **1.6. Testing Framework Setup:**  
  * Create vitest.config.ts, potentially extending @invenco-cloud-systems-ics/vitest-config, defining excludes.  
  * Add test scripts to package.json (test, coverage).  
* **1.7. Environment Configuration:**  
  * Create env/ directory with .env.local, .env.dev, etc., files.  
  * Implement environment loading logic (similar to src/utils/env.ts).  
* **1.8. Basic CI/CD Setup:**  
  * Create initial GitHub Actions workflows (build.yml) for linting and unit testing on push/PR, referencing reusable workflows if applicable.  
  * Configure necessary secrets (e.g., JF\_ACCESS\_TOKEN if used by generic workflows).

**Phase 2: Core Library Development (Estimated Time: 3-5 Weeks)**

* **2.1. Define Interfaces:**  
  * Establish core data structures and configuration types in src/interfaces/index.ts.  
* **2.2. Implement Core Logic:**  
  * Develop the main class(es) or functions (e.g., src/ics-event-stream.class.ts equivalent).  
  * Implement core business logic related to event handling/processing.  
* **2.3. Service Implementation:**  
  * Develop KafkaService (src/services/kafka.service.ts) handling connection, authentication (including IAM if needed via aws-msk-iam-sasl-signer-js), and message production/consumption.  
  * Develop ConfigService (src/services/config.service.ts) for managing local and remote configurations.  
* **2.4. Utility Functions:**  
  * Create helper functions in src/utils/ for logging (get-logger.ts), error handling (error.ts), environment variable preparation (prep.ts), AWS utilities (awsUtils.ts if needed), etc.  
* **2.5. Constants Definition:**  
  * Define constants like Kafka topics, event types, configuration keys in src/constants/.  
* **2.6. Unit Testing:**  
  * Write comprehensive unit tests (tests/unit/\*\*/\*.spec.ts) for all services, utilities, and core logic using vitest.  
  * Aim for high code coverage (significantly above the reference repo's 3.92%).  
* **2.7. Code Reviews:**  
  * Conduct regular code reviews for all implemented features and tests.

**Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Estimated Time: 2 Weeks)**

* **3.1. Integration Test Development:**  
  * Write integration tests (tests/integration/test.ts) covering end-to-end scenarios (e.g., publishing an event and verifying it).  
* **3.2. Local Test Environment:**  
  * Create docker-compose.yml (similar to tests/integration/resources/docker-compose.yml) to spin up local Kafka and Zookeeper instances.  
  * Add scripts to package.json for running integration tests against the local environment (e.g., test:integration:local).  
* **3.3. Scenario Testing:**  
  * Test various configurations, edge cases, and error conditions.  
  * Validate interaction with the Kafka cluster (message format, topic routing, partitioning if applicable).  
* **3.4. Coverage Analysis:**  
  * Run coverage reports (pnpm run coverage).  
  * Identify gaps and add tests to improve coverage.

**Phase 4: Documentation & Packaging (Estimated Time: 1 Week)**

* **4.1. README Documentation:**  
  * Write a detailed README.md covering: Overview, Installation (pnpm install), Configuration (environment variables, setup), Usage Examples (instantiation, key methods like add, publish), Testing Instructions (unit, integration), Contribution Guidelines.  
  * Include coverage badges (setup CI to update these).  
* **4.2. Code Comments:**  
  * Ensure thorough inline comments (using JSDoc or TSDoc style) explaining classes, methods, complex logic.  
* **4.3. Package Configuration:**  
  * Finalize package.json: Set name, version, description, author, license, main (pointing to dist/index.js), repository, bugs, homepage, engines, publishConfig (targeting GitHub Packages).  
  * Define scripts for build, clean, test, coverage, lint, format, publish.  
  * Configure \_moduleAliases to match tsconfig.json paths.  
* **4.4. Build Configuration:**  
  * Ensure the build script (rimraf ./dist && tsc && pnpm run copy-build) correctly compiles TypeScript, copies package.json, and potentially env files to the dist folder.  
  * Configure .npmignore to exclude source files, tests, config files, etc., from the published package.

**Phase 5: Deployment & Publishing (Estimated Time: 1 Week)**

* **5.1. Publishing Workflow:**  
  * Create/Refine the GitHub Actions workflow for publishing (publish.yml), potentially using reusable workflows like publish\_github\_package\_pnpm.yml.  
  * Ensure it triggers on desired events (e.g., merge to main, manual dispatch).  
  * Include steps for building, version bumping (optional, manual might be preferred initially), and publishing to GitHub Packages.  
* **5.2. CI/CD Secrets:**  
  * Configure GITHUB\_TOKEN secret in the repository settings with appropriate permissions (contents: write, packages: write).  
* **5.3. Test Publishing:**  
  * Perform a test publish using a pre-release tag (e.g., 1.0.0-beta.0) to verify the workflow.  
  * Install the test package in another project to ensure it works.  
* **5.4. Official Release:**  
  * Tag the release in Git.  
  * Run the publishing workflow for the official version.

**Phase 6: Maintenance & Iteration (Ongoing)**

* **6.1. Monitoring:** Monitor for issues reported by users or downstream services.  
* **6.2. Bug Fixing:** Address bugs promptly and publish patch releases.  
* **6.3. Feature Enhancements:** Plan and implement new features based on requirements or feedback.  
* **6.4. Dependency Updates:** Regularly update dependencies (using pnpm up \-Li) and test thoroughly.  
* **6.5. CI/CD Maintenance:** Keep CI/CD workflows up-to-date with best practices and security updates.

**5\. Assumptions**

* Access to necessary infrastructure (Kafka cluster for different environments \- dev, qa, prod).  
* Access to GitHub Packages and necessary permissions for publishing.  
* Availability of Invenco's internal GitHub Actions and configurations (@invenco-cloud-systems-ics/\*) if required.  
* Team familiarity with TypeScript, Node.js, Kafka, pnpm, Vitest, and GitHub Actions.

**6\. Potential Risks**

* **Configuration Complexity:** Managing different environment configurations (.env files, Kafka brokers, auth) can be error-prone. Mitigation: Clear documentation, validation scripts.  
* **Kafka Connectivity/Auth Issues:** Problems connecting to Kafka clusters, especially with IAM authentication. Mitigation: Thorough integration testing, clear setup guides, robust error handling in KafkaService.  
* **Low Test Coverage:** Failing to achieve adequate test coverage, leading to regressions. Mitigation: Enforce coverage thresholds in CI, dedicated testing phases.  
* **Dependency Conflicts/Vulnerabilities:** Issues arising from outdated or conflicting dependencies. Mitigation: Regular dependency updates, vulnerability scanning (e.g., pnpm audit).  
* **CI/CD Pipeline Failures:** Brittle or failing CI/CD workflows. Mitigation: Robust workflow design, monitoring, quick response to failures.

This plan provides a structured approach to developing the project, ensuring alignment with the practices and technologies of the reference ics-event-stream-lib. Adjust timelines and specific tasks based on project complexity and team velocity.
